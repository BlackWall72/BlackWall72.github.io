			<p> I am an IT guy by day. I enjoy many forms of music, primarly of the metal varity. I have had a passion for electronics and anything battery operated from
 a very young age. My primary use for this is to keep my skills fresh and try new things. I currently live in the South, Northern born (not that it matters). Anything else,
 shit, I don't know, guess?</p>
