or as I told my friend "take my shits".  Check back for stuff you can rip. </p>

			<p>Do you remember the marquee tag? All the crazy text running every which way. Well perhaps other things, such as images. Back then (with HTML 4.X) things were a really weird time where sometimes no matter what you did, things just wouldn't work right. I tried coding a marquee for an image a while ago. HTML5 hates marquee tags, not to mention it's probably not recommended to use marquees on images. A moment of silence for the marquee tag which has been depreciated in HTML 5. On the other side of this, I believe you could implement a Javascript to do the same thing, although Javascript is gross. RIP Marquee</p>
