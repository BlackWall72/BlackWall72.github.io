			<p>I've added bats to the navigational menu for the hell of it. I also did a few code corrections in other spots. I also forgot to mention on 09/25 that I had updated the date seal at the footer.</p>

			<p>So I added a secondary font to the first one. It's job is to kind of bridge the gap, as I recieved readability complaints from two people. Anyway Enjoy.</p>

			<p>Do you remember the marquee tag? All the crazy text running every which way. Along other things, such as images. Back then (with HTML 4.X) things were a really weird time where sometimes no matter what you did, things just wouldn't work right, or sometimes would malfunction just right. I tried coding a marquee for an image a while ago. HTML5 makes marquee tags obsolete, not to mention it's probably not recommended to use marquees on images, no mention of it on<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee"> MDN Web Docs </a>. A moment of silence for the marquee tag which has been depreciated in HTML 5. On the other side of this, I believe you could implement a Javascript to do the same thing, although Javascript is gross. RIP Marquee</p>
